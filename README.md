# Dropdown Menu CSS

A responsive menu in HTML / CSS.

## Introduction

Dropdown Menu CSS is a responsive menu written in HTML / CSS without Javascript. Flexbox was used for the layout. It has been tested up to 3 levels.

The first level is represented by a hamburger. The submenus use a plus or minus sign. Both icons are animated on click.

Dropdown Menu CSS also works with keyboard navigation for accessibility concerns.

## Disclaimer

The menu works with Edge/IE, but keyboard navigation does not work for submenus.
